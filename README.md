# Algorithms and Data Structures 🧠📊

This repository contains solutions and implementations of algorithms prepared as part of the course **Algorithms and Data Structures** in the second semester of the Computer Science program at AGH. You will find all the algorithms discussed in class, including:

- **Sorting Algorithms** 🔢 – various methods for sorting data,
- **Graph Algorithms** 🌐 – operations on graphs in both list and matrix representation,
- **Dynamic Algorithms** 🔄 – solving problems dynamically by breaking them down into subproblems and storing the results.

All implementations were written in **Python** 🐍 during the period from March to September 2023.
